1. Consider the following 2 lists:
b = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
p = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] 
      
calculate element-wise math.pow(b,p) using 
- a basic loop
- map
- list comprehension

2. Answer what you expect the output to be before running the code!
fruits = ['red apple', 'green apple', 'banana', 'kiwi']
for fruit in fruits:
    if 'apple' in fruit:
        fruits.append(fruit)
	print('Added a', fruit)

3. Count number of unique characters and occurrance frequency of each character in the string
str = 'AGCTTTTCATTCTGACTGCAACGGGCAATATGTCTCTGTGTGGATTAAAAAAAGAGTGTCTGATAGCAGC'
